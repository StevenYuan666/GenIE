        "description": "Stoke Hammond is a village and also a civil parish within Aylesbury Vale district in north Buckinghamshire, England, about two and a half miles south of Fenny Stratford (Milton Keynes). The village was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Stoche: a common place name in England denoting an Anglo-Saxon church or place of worship. The suffix Hammond was added later in manorial records though it refers to the family who owned the estate at the time of the Domesday survey. Hamon Brito, son of Mainfelin Brito, was the owner of the manor of Stoke in the 12th century. The manor later passed into the ownership of the Duke of Norfolk; the family still owned it at the end of the Victorian era. The Disney family, apparently related to the illustrator Walt Disney, was also at one time an influential family in the parish. The parish church is dedicated to St Luke. There is also a Methodist Chapel, built in 1927. The A4146 road passed through the village until the new bypass opened on 14 September 2007. The village is close to the West Coast Railway line, although there is no station in the village. The nearest stations are Bletchley and Leighton Buzzard. The Grand Union Canal passes close by the village. It is one of the 51 Thankful Villages which lost no men in the First World War, as first identified by the writer Arthur Mee in the 1930s. Famous residents include Toy Valentine, bassist with the all-girl punk band The Faders",

Produced by Flood, Brian Eno, and The Edge, it was released on 5 July 1993 on Island Records. Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record continued the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991. U2 began writing and recording for Zooropa in Dublin in February 1993, during a six-month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the \"Zooropa\" leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full-length LP. Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources. The album was not completed in time for the tour's resumption, forcing the band to travel between Dublin and their tour destinations in May to complete mixing and recording. Zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics. Despite none of its three singles\u2014\"Numb\", \"Lemon\", and \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\"\u2014being hits consistently across regions, the record sold well upon release and peaked at number one in multiple countries. The album's charting duration and lifetime sales of 7 million copies, however, were weaker than Achtung Baby. In 1994, Zooropa won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Although the record was a success and music journalists view the album as one of the group's most creative works, the band regard it with mixed feelings.",

It is a left tributary of the Volga River. It is 139 kilometres (86 mi) long, and the area of its basin 19,000 square kilometres (7,300 sq mi). The principal tributaries of the Sheksna are the Sizma (left) and the Kovzha (right). According to the Max Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary, the origin of the name of the river is unclear, but it may originate from a Uralic language.The urban-type settlement of Sheksna and Sheksninsky District are named after the river. The source of the Sheksna is in the southeastern end of Lake Beloye. The river flows south and subsequently turns east. It joins the northern part of the Rybinsk Reservoir of the Volga near the city of Cherepovets. Cherepovets, as well as the urban-type settlement of Sheksna, are located on the Sheksna. Most of the present course of the river was accommodated as the Sheksna Reservoir, with the dam constructed in Sheksna. Previously, the length of the Sheksna was some 400 kilometers (250 mi), and the mouth of the river was located in the city of Rybinsk, Yaroslavl Oblast. The part of the river between Cherepovets and Rybinsk disappeared when the Rybinsk Reservoir was constructed between 1935 and 1947. Currently, the only natural stretch of the course of the Sheksna is located between the urban-type settlement of Sheksna and the city of Cherepovets. The river basin of the Sheksna comprises vast areas in the west and in the northwest of Vologda Oblast, including parts of Vytegorsky, Vashkinsky, Kirillovsky, Belozersky, Sheksninsky, and Cherepovetsky Districts, as well as minor areas in Kargopolsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. This area includes the towns of Kirillov and Belozersk, as well as the urban-type settlement of Chyobsara and the selo of Lipin Bor, the administrative center of Vashkinsky District. The Sheksna is a part of the Volga-Baltic Waterway and is used for both cruise and cargo traffic. Both the Northern Dvina Canal, which connects the basins of the Volga and the Northern Dvina via Lake Kubenskoye, and the Belozersky Canal, bypassing Lake Beloye, connect to the Sheksna.",

It is sometimes known as Hartford-cum-Sapley, and in the past has been known as Hereford by Huntingdon, Herford, Hertford and Harford. All Saints' Church in Hartford is an Anglican church built in 1180 just on the north riverbank. The church has six bells. Despite the rival claim of Hertford, there is a good case for identifying Hartford as the venue of the English synod of 673.",

Historically part of the St Helens parish, it was absorbed into Ryde Borough in 1933 and in turn into Medina Borough in 1974. Oakfield largely consists of light industrial units and various developments of social housing. The area bounded by High Street, School Street and Reed Street was re-developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with Victorian stone-built cottages demolished to make way for local authority flats and houses. Also demolished was the Oakfield Junior School, in High Park Square, built to a design by Thomas Hellyer. Earlier local authority housing (pre and post war) exists in Harding Road, and later council-built properties can be found in Slade Road. The most recent development is Oak Vale, whose metal-clad walls dominate views from many other parts of Ryde. Victorian properties remain in parts of High Street, St John's Hill, Wood Street and Meaders Road as well as in Upper and Lower Highland Roads. In the 1960s Oakfield had its own butcher, a barbers shop, several pubs and the well-patronised Renown Fish Bar. June's greengrocer shop on the corner of Meaders Road and St Johns Hill was used as a location in the 1973 film That'll be the Day, featuring Ringo Starr and Rosemary Leach. Few of these businesses remain, although the chip shop survives under a different name. The church of St John, also designed by Hellyer, whilst described as being in Oakfield, would generally be considered to be outside the area, understood as being bounded by Alexandra Road to the east, St Johns Hill to the north, the Ryde to Shanklin Railway to the west, and open countryside to the south.",

        "description": "The Bisbee Mill is a historic gristmill at 66 East Street in Chesterfield, Massachusetts. Located on the Dead Branch of the Westfield River, the mill complex includes a wood frame mill building, along with its former mill pond, impounded by a dam across the river, and a canal that brought river water to the mill for power. Also included on the property is the site of the Damon sawmill, which was established in 1761, and the Pierce cornmill, which occupied a site north of the Bisbee mill building in 1823. The Pierce mill was moved to the site, from an earlier one that may also be on the grounds of the Bisbee mill complex. The Bisbee mill complex has an evolutionary history that begins with the establishment of the mill pond in 1823 by Elisha Bisbee. Neither the dam he built, nor an 1859 dam built to form a second mill pond, have survived. Bisbee also dug a canal to bring water to his new mill building; other canals would also have been dug for the other two mills, but traces of them have not yet been found, and their exact route is not known. The mill building on the site was used, modified, and added onto, by five generations of Bisbees, until it closed its doors in the 1960s. The property was acquired by the Chesterfield Historical Society, which has operated it since 1997 as the Bisbee Mill Museum. The main mill building started in 1823 as a single 2-1/2 story gable-ended wood frame block measuring 30 feet (9.1 m) by 24 feet (7.3 m). This was extended eastward in the 1850s with the addition of a second block, 20 feet (6.1 m) by 24 feet (7.3 m). The two sections were joined by their end gables, although at slightly different elevations. Both sections were originally on fieldstone foundations; these have been replaced in part with modern concrete, and in part strengthened by the addition of concrete. A third section was added to the building between 1888 and 1829. Measuring 12 feet (3.7 m) by 58 feet (18 m), this section had a shed roof, and was added to the south side of the main blocks. A fourth major addition was made in 1954, when another large section was added to the north side of the building. Inside the building are the working portions of the mill. The water power it provided was delivered to the three levels of the mill by shafts, gears, and belts, and operated a number of different types of machinery. The major operations were as a gristmill, a woodworking mill, and a smithy. On the bottom level, the wheel pit, located in the original 1823 part of the building, houses a turbine wheel that dates to 1919. All levels of the mill have been adapted to showcase equipment that was used in the mill during its more than 100 year active lifetime. The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.",

        "description": "Talk a Good Game is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Kelly Rowland. Formerly titled Year of the Woman, the album was released on June 14, 2013 through Universal Republic and its affiliated record labels. Incorporating a base core of R&B and pop music, Talk a Good Game was influenced by the likes of Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder amongst other of Rowland's idols. Rowland wanted the album to be a celebration of womanhood and referred to the record as her most personal album to date. On the album, she co-wrote all but one song, \"Freak\", a cover of the same 2010 song by entertainer Jamie Foxx from his fourth studio album Best Night of My Life. A deluxe edition, and Target-exclusive edition of the album featuring bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the twelve-track standard edition. Talk a Good Game was promoted with live renditions of the album's songs during the Lights Out Tour, a co-headline concert tour between Rowland and The-Dream. The album was also preceded by the release of the lead single, a Mike Will Made It and Marz production called \"Kisses Down Low\" which peaked in the top-thirty of the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. A second single, The-Dream-produced \"Dirty Laundry\", was released a month before the album and documents Rowland's initial jealousy of the success Beyonc\u00e9 attained in her solo career following the release of her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003); the song also talks about the domestic abuse that Rowland suffered during a previous relationship. Upon its release, music critics commended the album's cohesive sound and themes throughout, often noting Rowland's most personal and vulnerable lyrics as well as the strength of her vocals. Talk a Good Game debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 selling 68,000 copies in its opening week, becoming Rowland's third top ten album. The album also debuted at number four on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart, failing to match the number one peak that her last album, Here I Am (2011), reached. In 2014, Rowland parted ways with her label, wanting a new start elsewhere and signalling the end of the Talk a Good Game era; the album was her only release under Republic Records.",

It was released in 1991 and reached number one-hundred and eighteen on the Billboard 200 album chart. 2nd Wind includes the single \"Change Myself\" and was Rundgren's final studio album on a major label until 2004's Liars. As with its predecessor, Nearly Human, Rundgren chose to record the album 'live' with a full band, as opposed to playing all of the instruments himself. The album was recorded at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, California. Rundgren terminated his relationship with Warner Bros. Records shortly after its release. He was said to have grown increasingly unhappy with the label's insistence that he start including single-worthy material.[citation needed] The album includes three songs (\"The Smell of Money\", \"If I Have to Be Alone\" and \"Love in Disguise\") written for Rundgren's musical version of the Joe Orton play/screenplay Up Against It. \"Gaya's Eyes\" continues the new, more adult sound introduced on the preceding album Nearly Human. Always a believer in cutting-edge technology, Todd used the video for the album's only single, \"Change Myself,\" as a showcase for the NewTek Video Toaster, a desktop video card for the Commodore Amiga computer.",

Many of the artifacts recovered from the site are related to the fur trade, a large part of the Potawatomi economy and a source of cultural interaction between the Potawatomi and Europeans. The majority of the artifacts reflect traditional Potawatomi culture, including smoking pipes used for religious rituals. Items deriving from the U.S. government's efforts at the time to force European culture upon Native Americans represent less than 5% of those found at the site, a sign that these efforts were not particularly successful with the Potawatomi.",

He was one of the greatest running backs in California prep history, rushing for 4,901 yards and scoring 72 touchdowns. He was selected into the Sac-Joaquin section Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was also a great prep sprinter. As a junior in 1981, he won the 200 meters at the California State track meet with a legal wind-aided time of 20.8. As a senior in 1982, he ran 100 meters in 10.5 and had a hand-timed 10.4.\n\nIn 1981, he was named the California prep athlete of the year (for football and track) and was separately named the California prep football player of the year. After his senior football year, he also earned three national honors. He received the Dial Award as the outstanding scholar-athlete of the year. Making the 1982 \"Parade Magazine\" All-American team, he was named the national back of the year, despite very highly recruited Marcus Dupree from Philadelphia, Mississippi, who became a freshman sensation with the Oklahoma Sooners as a true freshman in 1982, being a contender. He was also selected for the Sam B. Nicola Trophy as the National High school Player of the Year by the Touchdown Club of Columbus, Ohio in 1981. In the 1982 Long Beach Press Telegram Best in the West football recruits rankings, he received 10 votes for the best college running back prospect on the West Coast which was the most a recruit could receive.\n\nOne of most highly recruited prep football players ever out of the State of California in 1981\u20131982, he verbally committed to the University of Washington about three weeks before National Signing Day on February 10, 1982, despite the Huskies already having RB Jacque Robinson who as a freshman was the MVP of the 1982 Rose Bowl game in which the Huskies beat Iowa 28\u20130. But on signing day, Willhite shocked the college football world and signed with the University of Oregon. Reportedly, he ultimately chose the Ducks over the Huskies because of the Ducks' track program.\n\nWillhite severely tore his hamstring during his senior high school track season in 1982 and then suffered further injuries at the University of Oregon during his freshman season, which resulted in him redshirting in 1982. He had an undistinguished college football career. Because of the effect of his injuries, he was switched to fullback where he was used mostly as a blocking back. He became a starter his senior year.\n\nDuring the NFL strike season of 1987, Willhite became a replacement player for the Green Bay Packers. In three games for the Packers, he rushed for 251 yards on 53 carries (4.7 avg), with a long run of 61 yards, but no touchdowns. He is the younger brother of former Denver Broncos' RB Gerald Willhite.",

Formed in 1986, they are best known for their 1989 single \"Living in Oblivion\". They also garnered some attention for releasing an album entirely in MP3 format in 2003. With a current lineup consisting solely of Claude Strilio, the past members have included long-time members Dania Morales and Paul Rijnders, as well as Carlos Pacheco, Mike Zacek, Gary Strilio, Dave South and Barry Bunch. The band is noted for its melodic, synth-driven dance beats from its early years as well as its fusion of electronics and guitars which is its current musical focus. The band also receives praise for its album artwork which ranges from oil paintings to electronic paintings which are all works of Claude Strilio. Anything Box (also known as Abox by fans) has released several albums, EPs, and singles, and continues to perform around the world.\n\nThe band's name comes from the title of a book of short stories by Zenna Henderson, \"The Anything Box\". In the title story, a young girl imagines the world as she would have it, apparently by staring at an empty space between her hands. Her school teacher discovers that the box is invisible, but real.\n\nAnything Box's most recent release is \"Peace\" (Endpop.com, January 2018) which is a remastered version of their first album, and features remixes of their hits \"Living in Oblivion\" and \"Jubilation\".",

Butrum found his way to Nashville and landed a job at WSM Radio. He eventually wound up a staff musician on the Grand Ole Opry, at age 16. From there, he played bass for Hank Williams' band \"The Drifting Cowboys.\" He would play with the Drifting Cowboys from 1949 until 1950. After the passing of Williams, Butrum joined Hank Snow's band, the Rainbow Ranch Boys, and later played on many Marty Robbins recording sessions. He'd eventually start a music publishing company with Robbins.\n\nHe established \"Butrum Enterprises Publishing Company\" and owned Look Records. He produced many early country music documentaries including \"Music City USA\". Butrum would tour again, from 1977 to 1984, with the reformed Drifting Cowboys.\n\nLater in life, Butrum became active in the \"Reunion of Professional Entertainers,\" and distributed vintage country music videos through Nashville retail stores and his website.\n\nHillous Butrum died in his Nashville home about two weeks after the death of his wife Phyllis (Frost) Butrum. His funeral was held in Goodlettsville, Tennessee and was attended by notable music industry figures including Hal Bynum, Merle Kilgore, Bobby Tomberlin, Robbie Wittkowski, Tim Jones, and Don Helms. He was interred in the Underwood Cemetery in his hometown of Lafayette.\n\nThe day before Butrum's death, he agreed to an exclusive interview with \"Country Music Source\" magazine detailing his long and inspiring music career. The interview was scheduled for April 29, 2002. In lieu of the interview, \"Country Music Source\" printed a memoriam for Butrum.",

In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the \"Salatin-i-Kashmir\" or Shah Mir dynasty. Kashmir was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to 1751, and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the \"paramountcy\" (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until the partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and China.",
